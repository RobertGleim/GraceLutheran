          <h3>
            The heart of our faith is our Lord Jesus Christ and the salvation
            which He has won through His death and resurrection for all who
            believe in Him. Through faith, we trust that forgiveness and life
            are given by grace alone. We also confess the historic Christian
            faith as drawn from Holy Scriptures and confessed in the creeds (the
            Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed) and the
            Book of Concord. We hold to the inerrancy, infallibility and divine
            inspiration of the Holy Scriptures which are used as the source and
            norm of all that is taught and confessed. The following, primarily
            drawn from the Small Catechism, is a brief explanation of what the
            Lutheran Church teaches, believes and confesses. The following can
            also be downloaded as a PDF file.

          <h4>Regarding the Holy Trinity ✝ </h4>
          <br />
          The Lutheran Church believes in the one, true God, who through the
          Holy Scriptures, has revealed Himself as one God in three co-equal and
          co-eternal Persons, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.{" "}

          <hr /> I believe that God has made me and all creatures; that he has
          given me my body and soul, eyes, ears, and all my members, my reason
          and all my senses, and still takes care of them. He also gives me
          clothing and shoes, food and drink, house and home, wife and children,
          land, animals, and all I have. He richly and daily provides me with
          all that I need to support this body and life. He defends me against
          all danger and guards and protects me from all evil. All this He does
          only out of fatherly, divine goodness and mercy, without any merit or
          worthiness in me. For all this it is my duty to thank and praise,
          serve and obey Him. The Lutheran Church teaches that God the Father…
          Created all that exists, seen and unseen, by the power of His Word in
          six days.{" "}

          <hr /> I believe that Jesus Christ, true God, begotten of the Father
          from eternity, and also true man, born of the Virgin Mary, is my Lord,
          who has redeemed me, a lost and condemned person, and purchased and
          won me from all sins, from death, and from the power of the devil; not
          with gold or silver, but with His holy, precious blood and with His
          innocent suffering and death, that I may be His own and live under Him
          in His kingdom and serve Him in everlasting righteousness, innocence,
          and blessedness, just as He is risen from the dead, lives and reigns
          to all eternity.
          <br />
          <br /> The Lutheran Church teaches that God the Son…
          <br /> Is true Man, taking our place under the Law and fulfilling it
          for us and suffering and dying for our guilt because we have failed to
          keep it. <span className="italic">Romans 5:19; Hebrews 2:14</span>
          <hr /> Is true God, whose death provided a sufficient ransom for all
          people and whose resurrection overcame death and the devil.{" "}

          <h4>Regarding God the Holy Spirit ✝ </h4>
          <br />
          (from Luther’s Small Catechism, The Explanation of the Third Article
          of the Apostles’ Creed) I believe that I cannot by my own reason or
          strength believe in Jesus Christ, my Lord, or come to Him; but the
          Holy Spirit has called me by the Gospel, enlightened me with His
          gifts, sanctified and kept me in the true faith. In the same way He
          calls, gathers, enlightens, and sanctifies the whole Christian church
          on earth, and keeps it with Jesus Christ in the one true faith. In
          this Christian church He daily and richly forgives all my sins and the
          sins of all believers. On the Last Day He will raise me and all the
          dead, and give eternal life to me and all believers in Christ. The
          Lutheran Church teaches that God the Holy Spirit… Calls us to and
          sustains and preserves us in the one, truth faith.<span className="italic"> I Peter 2:9;
          Philippians 1:6; I Peter 1:5</span><hr /> Sanctifies us, that is, guides us to live
          in holiness of life. <span className="italic">Ephesians 2:10; Psalm 51:10, 13; John 15:5</span> <hr />Keeps
          and sustains the Church. <span className="italic">Ephesians 2:19-22; Ephesians 4:3-6; I Peter
          2:5</span><hr /> Works through the means of grace (the Word, Holy Baptism, and the
          Lord’s Supper) to bring us the forgiveness of sin and the promise of
          eternal life.

        <div className="card card-6">
          <h4>Regarding Man ✝ </h4>
          <br />
          The Lutheran Church teaches that man… Was created in holiness,
          enjoying a perfect fellowship with and knowledge of God (original
          righteousness). <span className="italic">Genesis 1:26ff; Ephesians 4:34</span><hr /> Fell into sin and “are
          conceived and born in sin, that is, all men are full of evil lust and
          inclinations…and are unable by nature to have true fear of God and
          true faith in God. Moreover, this inborn sickness and hereditary sin
          is truly sin and condemns to the eternal wrath of God all those who
          are not born again through Baptism and the Holy Spirit.” (Augsburg
          Confession, Article II) (Original Sin)
          <span className="italic">

          <h4>Regarding the salvation of God ✝ </h4>
          <br />
          The Lutheran Church teaches that … Redemption from sin, death and hell
          is found only through faith in Redemption from sin, death and hell is
          found only through faith in Jesus Christ.<span className="italic"> Acts 4:12; John 14:6; I John
          5:11-12</span> <hr /> God justifies by grace through faith all who believe. <span className="italic">Romans
          3:21-23; Romans 5:1-2; Ephesians 2:8-9</span><hr /> We are received into fellowship
          with God through Holy Baptism.{" "}

          The Lutheran Church teaches that Holy Baptism is… The work of God
          through the application of water and the Word to work the adoption of
          fallen man by grace to be a child of God and an heir of eternal
